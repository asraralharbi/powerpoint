Face recognition is a method of identifying
or verifying the identity of an individual using
their face. Face recognition systems can be
used to identify people in photos, video, or
in real-time.
# NTRODUCTION
◦ Face recognition systems are part of facial image processing
applications and their significance as a research area are
increasing recently. 
# DESIGN
◦ various methods and combination of these methods can be
applied in development of a new face recognition system.
# Algorithm
◦ The most evident face features were used in the beginning of
face recognition. It was a sensible approach to mimic human
face recognition ability.
# problem
◦ improved the performance of automated face recognition
algorithms on a variety of challenging face recognition tasks. 
# Model Architecture
◦ We all know that training a Convolution Neural Network(CNN)
from scratch takes a lot of data and also compute power. So we
instead use transfer learning, where a model trained on similar
data is fine-tuned as per our requirement.
